# Australian geometric PDE seminar

Australian seminar on geometric PDE. We aim towards a reading/learning seminar but also host research talks. The goal is to be accessible to graduate students. Recordings of past talks are available on the [Australian Geometric PDE Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtVSqYN2CGISZZdN56Y5fMw)

Contact [Paul Bryan](mailto:pabryan@gmail.com?subject=Australian%20geometric%20PDE%20seminar) for information on participating (attending live sessions, giving a talk, suggesting topics/speakers etc.)
